# PET-Head-and-Neck-Standardization
 Standardization of multicentric PET data.

## Info
This repo intends to evaluate the impact of multicentric data on Radiomics studies and is currently in progress.

For now, only preprocessing of the data has been done.  

## Dataset
The dataset is an open dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and consists of 298 Head and Neck PET/CT scans from four different centers [1] [2].
